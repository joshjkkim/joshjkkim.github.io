                End-to-end encrypted file hosting platform based off of sites like catbox.moe and pomf.se <br><br>
                Honestly started as a fun project because I was invested in cryptography and cybersecurity and thought I would take
                stuff like file hosting and security to the next level by implementing panels <br><br>
                Essentially servers for batch file uploads and viewing however relies on AES-GCM encryption to create symmetrical keys
                that can be used to decrypt said file or adds a header to the link so that you can automatically decrypt the file upon load
                Yet files cannot be decrypted or viewed without loading the page as all decryption and encryption is done clientside <br><br>
                Afterwards the inclusion of a panel was needed, stuff to prematurely delete a file before its expiry date or track recent accesses and total times viewed <br><br>
                Then I got a bit bored so I added a forum similar to other file sharing/market places across the web with reputation posting and ranks for moderation. <br>
                This was all hosted on postgres for the posts forums and file metadata however files are hosted in S3 bucket <br>
                Recently added file url shorteners such as "ddfh.org/s/dumdum" that can be claimed by authenticated users (I made my own authentication based on seed phrase)
                and then can assign, transer, or delete such url links. Yet ephemeral temporary ones can be generated by non authenticated users as the whole point is anonymity.
